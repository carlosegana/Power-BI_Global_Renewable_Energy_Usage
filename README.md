## Project Description
This interactive **Power BI dashboard** analyzes the implementation of **renewable energy sources** worldwide from **2020 to 2024**. It allows users to visualize adoption levels in **urban and rural areas**, compare countries and continents, and quickly gain insights into the global progress toward sustainable energy.

**Business Question:**  
> How are renewable energies being implemented across different countries and regions, and what geographic factors influence their adoption?
